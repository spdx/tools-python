## Breaking changes v0.7 -> v0.8

Please be aware that the upcoming 0.8 release has undergone a significant refactoring in preparation for the upcoming
SPDX v3.0 release, leading to breaking changes in the API.
Please refer to the [migration guide](https://github.com/spdx/tools-python/wiki/How-to-migrate-from-0.7-to-0.8)
to update your existing code.

The main features of v0.8 are:

- full validation of SPDX documents against the v2.2 and v2.3 specification
- support for SPDX's RDF format with all v2.3 features
- experimental support for the upcoming SPDX v3 specification. Note, however, that support is neither complete nor
  stable at this point, as the spec is still evolving. SPDX3-related code is contained in a separate subpackage "spdx3"
  and its use is optional. We do not recommend using it in production code yet.

## License

[Apache-2.0](LICENSE)

## Features

- API to create and manipulate SPDX v2.2 and v2.3 documents
- Parse, convert, create and validate SPDX files
- Supported formats: Tag/Value, RDF, JSON, YAML, XML
- Visualize the structure of a SPDX document by creating an `AGraph`.
  Note: This is an optional feature and requires
  additional installation of optional dependencies

## Experimental support for SPDX 3.0

- Create v3.0 elements and payloads
- Convert v2.2/v2.3 documents to v3.0
- Serialize to JSON-LD

See [Quickstart to SPDX 3.0](#quickstart-to-spdx-30) below.
The implementation is based on the descriptive Markdown files in the repository
<https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model>
(commit: a5372a3c145dbdfc1381fc1f791c68889aafc7ff).
The latest SPDX 3.0 model is available at
<https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/serializations/>.

## Installation

As always you should work in a virtualenv (venv). You can install a local clone
of this repo with `yourenv/bin/pip install .` or install it from PyPI
(check for the [newest release](https://pypi.org/project/spdx-tools/#history) and install it like
`yourenv/bin/pip install spdx-tools==0.8.3`). Note that on Windows it would be `Scripts`
instead of `bin`.

## How to use

### Command-line usage

1. **PARSING/VALIDATING** (for parsing any format):

    - Use `pyspdxtools -i <filename>` where `<filename>` is the location of the file. The input format is inferred automatically from the file ending.

    - If you are using a source distribution, try running:
      `pyspdxtools -i tests/spdx/data/SPDXJSONExample-v2.3.spdx.json`

2. **CONVERTING** (for converting one format to another):

    - Use `pyspdxtools -i <input_file> -o <output_file>` where `<input_file>` is the location of the file to be converted
      and `<output_file>` is the location of the output file. The input and output formats are inferred automatically from the file endings.

    - If you are using a source distribution, try running:
      `pyspdxtools -i tests/spdx/data/SPDXJSONExample-v2.3.spdx.json -o output.tag`

    - If you want to skip the validation process, provide the `--novalidation` flag, like so:
      `pyspdxtools -i tests/spdx/data/SPDXJSONExample-v2.3.spdx.json -o output.tag --novalidation`
  (use this with caution: note that undetected invalid documents may lead to unexpected behavior of the tool)

    - For help use `pyspdxtools --help`

3. **GRAPH GENERATION** (optional feature)

    - This feature generates a graph representing all elements in the SPDX document and their connections based on the provided
      relationships. The graph can be rendered to a picture. Below is an example for the file `tests/spdx/data/SPDXJSONExample-v2.3.spdx.json`:
      ![SPDXJSONExample-v2.3.spdx.png](assets/SPDXJSONExample-v2.3.spdx.png)

    - Make sure you install the optional dependencies `networkx` and `pygraphviz`. To do so run `pip install ".[graph_generation]"`.
    - Use `pyspdxtools -i <input_file> --graph -o <output_file>` where `<output_file>` is an output file name with valid format for `pygraphviz` (check
      the documentation [here](https://pygraphviz.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/agraph.html#pygraphviz.AGraph.draw)).
    - If you are using a source distribution, try running
      `pyspdxtools -i tests/spdx/data/SPDXJSONExample-v2.3.spdx.json --graph -o SPDXJSONExample-v2.3.spdx.png` to generate
      a png with an overview of the structure of the example file.

### Library usage

1. **DATA MODEL**

    - The `spdx_tools.spdx.model` package constitutes the internal SPDX v2.3 data model (v2.2 is simply a subset of this). All relevant classes for SPDX document creation are exposed in the `__init__.py` found [here](src%2Fspdx_tools%2Fspdx%2Fmodel%2F__init__.py).
    - SPDX objects are implemented via `@dataclass_with_properties`, a custom extension of `@dataclass`.
    - Each class starts with a list of its properties and their possible types. When no default value is provided, the property is mandatory and must be set during initialization.
    - Using the type hints, type checking is enforced when initializing a new instance or setting/getting a property on an instance
      (wrong types will raise `ConstructorTypeError` or `TypeError`, respectively). This makes it easy to catch invalid properties early and only construct valid documents.
    - Note: in-place manipulations like `list.append(item)` will circumvent the type checking (a `TypeError` will still be raised when reading `list` again). We recommend using `list = list + [item]` instead.
    - The main entry point of an SPDX document is the `Document` class from the [document.py](src%2Fspdx_tools%2Fspdx%2Fmodel%2Fdocument.py) module, which links to all other classes.
    - For license handling, the [license_expression](https://github.com/nexB/license-expression) library is used.
    - Note on `documentDescribes` and `hasFiles`: These fields will be converted to relationships in the internal data model. As they are deprecated, these fields will not be written in the output.

2. **PARSING**

    - Use `parse_file(file_name)` from the `parse_anything.py` module to parse an arbitrary file with one of the supported file endings.
    - Successful parsing will return a `Document` instance. Unsuccessful parsing will raise `SPDXParsingError` with a list of all encountered problems.

3. **VALIDATING**

    - Use `validate_full_spdx_document(document)` to validate an instance of the `Document` class.
    - This will return a list of `ValidationMessage` objects, each consisting of a String describing the invalidity and a `ValidationContext` to pinpoint the source of the validation error.
    - Validation depends on the SPDX version of the document. Note that only versions `SPDX-2.2` and `SPDX-2.3` are supported by this tool.

4. **WRITING**

    - Use `write_file(document, file_name)` from the `write_anything.py` module to write a `Document` instance to the specified file.
    The serialization format is determined from the filename ending.
    - Validation is performed per default prior to the writing process, which is cancelled if the document is invalid. You can skip the validation via `write_file(document, file_name, validate=False)`.
    Caution: Only valid documents can be serialized reliably; serialization of invalid documents is not supported.

### Example

Here are some examples of possible use cases to quickly get you started with the spdx-tools.
If you want more examples, like how to create an SPDX document from scratch, have a look [at the examples folder](examples).

```python
import logging

from license_expression import get_spdx_licensing

from spdx_tools.spdx.model import (Checksum, ChecksumAlgorithm, File,
                                   FileType, Relationship, RelationshipType)
from spdx_tools.spdx.parser.parse_anything import parse_file
from spdx_tools.spdx.validation.document_validator import validate_full_spdx_document
from spdx_tools.spdx.writer.write_anything import write_file

# read in an SPDX document from a file
document = parse_file("spdx_document.json")

# change the document's name
document.creation_info.name = "new document name"

# define a file and a DESCRIBES relationship between the file and the document
checksum = Checksum(ChecksumAlgorithm.SHA1, "71c4025dd9897b364f3ebbb42c484ff43d00791c")

file = File(name="./fileName.py", spdx_id="SPDXRef-File", checksums=[checksum],
            file_types=[FileType.TEXT],
            license_concluded=get_spdx_licensing().parse("MIT and GPL-2.0"),
            license_comment="licenseComment", copyright_text="copyrightText")

relationship = Relationship("SPDXRef-DOCUMENT", RelationshipType.DESCRIBES, "SPDXRef-File")

# add the file and the relationship to the document
# (note that we do not use "document.files.append(file)" as that would circumvent the type checking)
document.files = document.files + [file]
document.relationships = document.relationships + [relationship]

# validate the edited document and log the validation messages
# (depending on your use case, you might also want to utilize the validation_message.context)
validation_messages = validate_full_spdx_document(document)
for validation_message in validation_messages:
    logging.warning(validation_message.validation_message)

# if there are no validation messages, the document is valid
# and we can safely serialize it without validating again
if not validation_messages:
    write_file(document, "new_spdx_document.rdf", validate=False)
```

## Quickstart to SPDX 3.0

In contrast to SPDX v2, all elements are now subclasses of the central `Element` class.
This includes packages, files, snippets, relationships, annotations, but also SBOMs, SpdxDocuments, and more.
For serialization purposes, all Elements that are to be serialized into the same file are collected in a `Payload`.
This is just a dictionary that maps each Element's SpdxId to itself.
Use the `write_payload()` functions to serialize a payload.
There currently are two options:

- The `spdx_tools.spdx3.writer.json_ld.json_ld_writer` module generates a JSON-LD file of the payload.
- The `spdx_tools.spdx3.writer.console.payload_writer` module prints a debug output to console. Note that this is not an official part of the SPDX specification and will probably be dropped as soon as a better standard emerges.

You can convert an SPDX v2 document to v3 via the `spdx_tools.spdx3.bump_from_spdx2.spdx_document` module.
The `bump_spdx_document()` function will return a payload containing an `SpdxDocument` Element and one Element for each package, file, snippet, relationship, or annotation contained in the v2 document.
